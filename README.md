CHANGELOG:
==================================================
- Initial Commit


BEFORE YOU START:
==================================================
You **SHOULD** not use this software to copy and distribute Images from Reddit. I do not support this. The reason I created this bot is to automatically download images for neural networks from Reddit to speed the process up. The EXE is self-contained and does not require anything else to run. If you use this for any purposes that may be malicious it's purely your doing and I'm not responsible for what is done with this software.

If any questions arise feel free to ask me on Twitter @LeechFilcher.

About Commits:
==================================================
I will probably not work a ton on this anymore, at least if there are no issues arising for people. This is coded pretty robustly and as long as you have an internet connection that was not banned from reddit, all should be fine.
